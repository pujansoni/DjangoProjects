Installation
-> pip install ipdb

Set a breakpoint, insert the following into the code where you would like to access the interactive shell and start debugging
-> import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()

Once the script has hit the line of code you can start inspecting. Some useful commands to note are:
list -> list the 11 lines of code surrounding the breakpoint
n -> next: continues execution, executes the current statement
s -> step: execute and step into function
c -> continue: continue to the next breakpoint
